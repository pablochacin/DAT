DAT (Distributed Algorithm Testbed is a tool for developing distributed algorithm. 
It offers a programming interface (API) and the basic supporting functionalities 
to execute these algorithm in multiple nodes located in the same machine or 
distributed across different machines. 

Each node offers an execution context for one or more algorithm and the application 
that uses them. This context allows each algorithm exchange  messages with instances 
of the same algorithm in other nodes.
 
Each algorithm implements one or more interfaces that defines its function 
(for example, leader election) which can be used by the application or other 
algorithms.
